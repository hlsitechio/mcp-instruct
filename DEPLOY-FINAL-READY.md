3. **Deploy** ✅
4. **Process Functions** ✅

## What's Included:
- `package.json` & `package-lock.json` - Dependencies

3. **Watch the Build Process**
   You should see:
   - ✅ Initializing
   - ✅ Building (npm ci --omit=dev)
   - ✅ Deploying
   - ✅ Post-processing
   - ✅ **Functions: 1 new function created**

## ✨ What's Different This Time:

- **Includes package.json** - Netlify knows it's a Node.js project
- **Simple build command** - `npm ci --omit=dev` avoids PowerShell issues
- **TypeScript function** - Will be compiled by Netlify
- **Proper structure** - All files in expected locations

## 🧪 Test After Deployment:

### 1. Check Functions Tab:
Go to: https://app.netlify.com/sites/superb-trifle-6be3cb/functions

You should see:
- `mcp-bridge` function listed

### 2. Test Health Endpoint:
```bash
curl https://superb-trifle-6be3cb.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/mcp-bridge/health
```

Expected: `{"status":"healthy","version":"1.0.0"}`

### 3. Test with API Key:
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
     https://superb-trifle-6be3cb.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/mcp-bridge/agents
```

## 🔗 Connect to ChatGPT:

Once the function is deployed:

```json
{
  "url": "https://superb-trifle-6be3cb.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/mcp-bridge",
  "api_key": "YOUR_MCP_API_KEY",
  "project_id": "50e72970-27ba-4525-9a3f-dce5d5e8acbd"
}
```

## ⚠️ Important:

If the build still skips:
1. Click **"Deploy settings"**
2. Under **"Build settings"**
3. Set **Base directory**: Leave empty
4. Set **Build command**: `npm ci --omit=dev`
5. Set **Publish directory**: `public`
6. Set **Functions directory**: `netlify/functions`
7. Save and redeploy
