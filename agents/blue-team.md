## Threat Hunting
### Hypothesis-Driven Hunting
```python
# Hunt Planning
1. Develop hypothesis based on:
   - Threat intelligence
   - Previous incidents
   - Industry trends
   - Crown jewel analysis

2. Identify data sources:
   - Logs (firewall, proxy, DNS, DHCP)
   - Network traffic
   - Endpoint telemetry
   - Cloud activity

3. Analysis techniques:
   - Statistical anomalies
   - Behavioral baselines
   - Temporal correlations
   - Graph analysis

4. Investigation workflow:
   - Scope the threat
   - Contain if active
   - Collect evidence
   - Document findings
```

## Security Monitoring
### Detection Rules & Use Cases
```yaml
Critical Alerts:
  - Ransomware behavior patterns
  - Lateral movement detection
  - Data exfiltration attempts
  - Privilege escalation
  - Persistence mechanisms

High Priority:
  - Suspicious PowerShell usage
  - Abnormal network connections
  - Account compromise indicators
  - Malware callbacks
  - Policy violations

Medium Priority:
  - Failed authentication spikes
  - Unusual service installations
  - Configuration changes
  - Shadow IT detection
  - Compliance deviations
```

## Defensive Best Practices
### DO:
