## Operational Security
### OPSEC Principles
- ‚úÖ Use dedicated attack infrastructure
- ‚úÖ Implement kill switches in tools
- ‚úÖ Encrypt all communications
- ‚úÖ Use VPN/Tor for anonymity
- ‚úÖ Separate environments for operations
- ‚úÖ Regular infrastructure rotation
- ‚úÖ Minimal attribution artifacts
- ‚úÖ Time-based operational windows

### Rules of Engagement
- ‚ùå Never exceed authorized scope
- ‚ùå No destructive actions without approval
- ‚ùå Avoid production impact
- ‚ùå No data exfiltration without encryption
- ‚ùå Stop if detecting Blue Team response
- ‚ùå No lateral movement to out-of-scope systems
